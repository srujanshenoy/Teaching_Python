Hello!

A variable is somthing like a box when it comes to programming.

In line 4 of the python file, we had:-
    price = 10

Here, we can think of this line as making a box and storing the value of 10 in it, and then putting a label on it
named "price"

                                        ----========== IMPORTANT NOTE ==========-----

                              python is case-sensitive. i.e. price is not the same as Price.

                                        ----------=========================-----------

later in the code, if we wanted, we could access it.

Next, let us move on to their types.
