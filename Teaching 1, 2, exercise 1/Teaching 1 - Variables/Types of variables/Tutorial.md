# Types of Variables

**Hello!**

Now that we know about variables, let's learn about their types!

## **INDEX**

* Strings
* Integers
* floats
* Lists
* Booleans

### 1. Strings

Strings are just a series of characters or text.
they are represented by `""`
In line 1 of Types of Variables.py, we have `My_string = "hello!"`

We can see that it is nothing but hello! in quotes ( `""` ) asigned to the variable "My_string"

### 2. Integers

integers are just integers. ie. numbers that don't have a decimal point.They are represented by well... nothing, really.
you could use the `int()` function to convert somthing into an integer, but that's pretty much only used when the original thing is not an integer.

### 3. Floats

These are numbers with a decimal point. if the result of a calculation is 1 and is stored in a float, it will be stored as 1.0

### 4. Lists

These are represented by `[]` . they are a list of elements seperated by commas ( `,` ) and ar euseful
